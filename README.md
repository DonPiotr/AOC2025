# Advent of Code 2025 - First time in Go

For my previous AoC in Ruby look here:

* AoC 2021 - I did some of it in november 2024 waiting for AoC 2024
* AoC 2022 - no repository, probably I have it on some old USB drive
* [AoC 2023](https://bitbucket.org/Don_Piotr/adventofcode2023)
* [AoC 2024](https://bitbucket.org/Don_Piotr/aoc2024)

I'm seriously convinced that Ruby is most elegant language to code in.
But there are few projects written in Go which I'm interested in.
In the past I watched [GoLang Tutorial by Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I),
but starting AoC 2025 I discovered I don't remember anything.
I opened AI tab and started to ask simple questions like:

* How to read data from standard input in Go?
* How to define an array in Go?
* How to loop through an array in Go?
* ...

So yes, I was halped by AI for AoC 2025, but only for simple Go releated things.

First thoughts about Go:

> It is ugly when I compare it with Ruby.
> But probably I can spot its own why.
